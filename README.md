# 🌟 Project Title

**AI Watermark Detection for Intellectual Property Protection of Diffusion Models**

## Overview

This project, undertaken as part of the **SAMSUNG PRISM** program, focuses on the detection of watermarks embedded in diffusion models. These watermarks are designed to protect the intellectual property (IP) of AI models by ensuring traceability and verification of model ownership. The watermark detection process uses advanced machine learning and AI techniques to verify model integrity while preserving performance and accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement a robust system for embedding and detecting watermarks in diffusion models.
- Develop algorithms for watermark verification and IP protection.
- Maintain model performance and accuracy while ensuring watermark traceability.
- Provide solutions to prevent model theft or misuse.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The project is divided into the following key components:
1. **🖼️ Watermark Embedding Module**: Integrates the watermark during model training.
2. **🔍 Watermark Detection Module**: Detects the embedded watermark from model outputs.
3. **🔐 Verification System**: Verifies the ownership of the model by comparing the extracted watermark with a reference.
4. **💻 User Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for watermark verification.

## ⚙️ Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.8 or above
- 🧠 TensorFlow/PyTorch
- 🖼️ OpenCV
- 📦 Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### 🔧 Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/watermark-detection.git
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up the dataset (if necessary).

## 🚀 Usage
To use the watermark detection system, follow these steps:

1. **🔐 Embedding Watermark**:
    ```bash
    python embed_watermark.py --input model_path --output watermarked_model_path
    ```

2. **🔍 Detecting Watermark**:
    ```bash
    python detect_watermark.py --input model_path
    ```

3. **✅ Verify Watermark**:
    ```bash
    python verify_watermark.py --model watermarked_model --reference watermark_reference
    ```

## 📂 Dataset
- The project uses a dataset of diffusion models with embedded watermarks.
- A subset of the dataset is publicly available in the `/dataset` directory.
- The dataset includes both clean models (without watermarks) and watermarked models for testing.

## 📊 Results
- The system successfully detected watermarks with an accuracy of **XX%**.
- Performance was preserved with a loss of less than **XX%** in model inference time.
- Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the `results` folder.
